  		  	<p id="about"> My name is Katie Kerkman and I am a 25 year old computer programming boot camp student. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I grew up there with two sisters and a brother and stayed there untiL I went out to western New York to attend college at St. Bonaventure University where I played soccer all four years and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in history.</p>
  		  	<p> After college, I became a snowboard/ski instructor before finding my way to Detroit as a social media manager. When I figured that was not the career path for me, I attended a free intro to coding classes here before being accepted into the Javascript bootcamp here. </p>
